# Full-Stack Online Recipe Book Application

## Description:

After too many food splattered receipe cards, this project aims to develop a full-stack web application for storing, editing, and adding recipes online.

The application will provide a user-friendly interface for managing my recipes. I also want to intergrate a blog/comment section on each page, so that I can leave notes for myself for the future.

## Features:

1. **User Authentication:** For adding, commenting and deleting
2. **Recipe Management:** View, add, edit, and delete recipes.
3. **Comments and Reviews:** Ability to comment on recipes.
4. **Search and Filter:** Search for recipes by name, category
5. **Responsive Design:** The application will be responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Java, Springboot
